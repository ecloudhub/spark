# Spark

## Introduction

Spark is our React component library.

<br/>

## Installation

1. Create a personal access token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (with ```repo``` and ```write:packages``` permissions).
2. Create or edit -if you already have it- the file ```.npmrc``` in your home directory like: ```~/.npmrc``` and add the following information: 
```
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
@chispahub:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```
replacing ```YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN``` with the token you just created in the first step.

3. Ask [Ju](https://github.com/juciccio) to give you access to the pacakge.
